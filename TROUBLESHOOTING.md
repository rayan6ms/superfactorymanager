This error shows only when debugging the run configuration, running it in normal mode worked properly.
Was able to fix this by downgrading IDEA from 2024.3 to 2024.2.4.
Also did `gradlew --no-daemon clean` and `gradlew --no-daemon --refresh-dependencies build` somewhere in between.
Also renamed `.idea` to `.idea.bak` and invalidated caches a few times.
Cursed error but seems to have been quelled for now.

Today, 2025-01-10: I was happily using IDEA Ultimate edition 2024.3 but had to switch to IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition and I tried version `2024.3.1.1` but re-encountered the above error.
Downgrading to IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition `2023.3.8` has restored my ability to use the IntelliJ run configurations to launch the game in debug mode.


## General things to try when something isn't working

-   ```pwsh
    .\gradlew.bat --no-daemon clean
    ```

-   ```pwsh
    .\gradlew --no-daemon --refresh-dependencies build
    ```

- remove run configurations from intellij gui and run the `genIntellijRuns` gradle tasl

- run the `runData` gradle task to generate missing files and apply changes
- [neoforged/RenderNurse](https://github.com/neoforged/RenderNurse/tree/main) may help with debugging graphics problems but I personally haven't tried it
- Look at the run configuration and make sure the correct JDK and module are specified
- If you have problems with `runClient` not working in debug mode, try it in normal play mode first. If that fails, try running the gradle task directly instead of using the IntelliJ run configuration.
- Go to project structure and remove all the modules, remove all the run configurations, and re-import the Gradle project, then run `genIntellijRuns`
