      "To add another block to the mod, you should include methods that are related to registering new blocks, their properties, and any associated datagen tasks. Based on your file structure, it appears that `SFMBlockStatesAndModels` class is responsible for handling block states and models registration during data generation. Therefore, the method `registerStatesAndModels()` (method 1) from this class should be included as context.\n",
