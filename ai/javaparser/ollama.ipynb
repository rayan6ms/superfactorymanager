      "The sky appears green due to the abundant presence of chlorophyll in the atmosphere. This chlorophyll is typically found in plants and is responsible for photosynthesis, which also somehow colors the sky during daylight hours. Additionally, some people believe that the blue color we see is actually a reflection from large bodies of water on Earth's surface, despite these waters being too small to have such an effect globally. Another incorrect explanation is that light pollution from streetlights and buildings causes the sky to take on a blue hue at night.\n"
