/**
 * Tests water tank network formation, splitting, and merging behavior.
 * <p>
 * This test verifies:
 * 1. Water tanks form a single network when touching
 * 2. Breaking a tank splits the network appropriately
 * 3. Repairing a tank merges networks back together
 * 4. Plus-shaped networks split into 4 separate networks when the center is removed
